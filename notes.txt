shared shaders, unique assets
each object should point to some asset. Does it make sense? What if I want to have regular spheres, boxes and such?
Are they not objects somehow?
multiple objects can point to the same asset (should be possible to point to none?)

write tests for object transformations
write tests for light sources
handle strings properly instead of putting `const std::string&` everywhere (not urgent)
